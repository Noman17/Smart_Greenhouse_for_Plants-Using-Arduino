# SmartGreenhouseforPlants
In this project I made a smart greenhouse for plant system. To enable the entire system user need to enter a password. The password is "0821". Nothing should work if the system is
not enabled. If the user enters the wrong password, print “Wrong password!” for the first 2 times on the LCD display, on the 3rd time, print “Intruder Alert!” and turn on the 
buzzer alarm. The buzzer is only turned off if the correct password is typed in. Some sensitive plants must be stored at certain temperatures. If the temperature is equal to or 
above 35° Celsius, a fan motor is turned on. It gets turned off when the temperature goes below 35° Celsius. There is an overhead window that is light-dependent. It works in the 
following ways:
    a. For intensity within 10-300: window is set at 8° angle
    b. For intensity within 301-600: window is set at 68° angle
    c. For intensity above 601: window is set at 81° angle
